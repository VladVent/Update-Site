  <p class="song"> RISE</p>
  <p>All I see is shattered pieces,<br />
    I can't keep it hidden like a secret,<br />
    I can't look away<br />
    From all this pain in the world we've made.<br />
    <br />
    Every day you need a bulletproof vest<br />
    To save yourself from what you could never guess<br />
    Am I safe today,<br />
    When I step outside in the wars we wage?<br />
    <br />
    Our future's here and now,<br />
    Here comes the countdown...<br />
    <br />
    Sound it off, this is our call:<br />
    Rise and revolution!<br />
    It's our time to change it all:<br />
    Rise and revolution!<br />
    <br />
    Unite and fight<br />
    To make a better life!<br />
    Everybody, one for all!<br />
    Sound off, this is the call:<br />
    <br />
    Tonight we rise!<br />
    Rise!<br />
    Tonight we rise!<br />
    Rise!<br />
    <br />
    Tonight we rise!<br />
    <br />
    Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane,<br />
    Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame.<br />
    Yesterday is gone<br />
    Faster than the blast of a car bomb.<br />
    <br />
    And when the scars heal, the pain passes<br />
    As hope burns, we rise from the ashes.<br />
    Darkness fades away,<br />
    And the light shines on a brave new day.<br />
    <br />
    Our future's here and now,<br />
    Here comes the countdown...<br />
    <br />
    Sound it off, this is our call:<br />
    Rise and revolution!<br />
    It's our time to change it all:<br />
    Rise and revolution!<br />
    <br />
    Unite and fight<br />
    To make a better life!<br />
    Everybody, one for all!<br />
    Sound off, this is the call:<br />
    <br />
    Tonight we rise!<br />
    Rise!

  <div id="native_roll"></div>
  <br />
  Tonight we rise!<br />
  Rise!<br />
  <br />
  Tonight we rise!<br />
  <br />
  In a world gone mad (in a voice so sad)<br />
  Sometimes it's crazy (crazy)<br />
  To fight for what you believe<br />
  But you can't give up (No)<br />
  If you want to keep what you love... (Keep what you love)<br />
  Keep what you love... (Keep what you love)<br />
  Keep what you love...<br />
  Never give up! No!<br />
  <br />
  Rise! Rise and revolution!<br />
  Rise! Rise and revolution!<br />
  Everybody one for all,<br />
  Sound off, this is the call:<br />
  <br />
  Rise! Like we're alive!<br />
  Tonight we rise!<br />
  Rise! Make a better life!<br />
  Tonight we rise!<br />
  <br />
  Rise!<br />
  <br />
  Rise! Rise!<br />
  Rise and revolution!<br />
  Rise! Rise!<br />
  Rise and revolution!<br />
  <br />
  Rise!<br />
