    If you're sick<br />
    If you're sick of it!<br />
    <br />
    When everything you do<br />
    Don't seem to matter.<br />
    Your try but it's no use<br />
    Your world is getting blacker<br />
    <br />
    When every time you fail<br />
    Has no answer.<br />
    Every empty promise made<br />
    His own reminder.<br />
    <br />
    No one can make this better<br />
    Take control it's now or never!<br />
    <br />
    Are you sick of it?<br />
    Raise your hands, get rid of it!<br />
    While there's a fighting chance...<br />
    Are you over it?<br />
    Bored to death?<br />
    Have you had enough regret?<br />
